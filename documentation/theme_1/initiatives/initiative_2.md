"DevOps"

Description: This initiative aims to implement a DevOps approach to software development and deployment, in order to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

Goals:

* To reduce deployment time and errors
* To increase collaboration and communication between development and operations teams
* To increase overall software quality and reliability

Scope: This initiative will cover the implementation of DevOps processes and tools, including continuous integration and delivery, automated testing, and infrastructure automation.

Outcomes:

* Reduced deployment time and errors
* Increased collaboration and communication between development and operations teams
* Increased overall software quality and reliability

Deliverables:

* Continuous integration and delivery pipeline
* Automated testing suite
* Infrastructure automation tools

Milestones:

* Completion of continuous integration and delivery pipeline (2 weeks)
* Completion of automated testing suite (4 weeks)
* Implementation of infrastructure automation tools (6 weeks)

Constraints: Limited budget for infrastructure automation tools.

Assumptions: All team members are willing and able to learn and adopt the new DevOps processes and tools.

Risks: Resistance to change from some team members; mitigation strategy is to provide clear communication and training to all team members.

Dependencies: Integration with existing development and deployment processes.

Team:

* DevOps Engineer: responsible for implementing DevOps processes and tools
* Developers: responsible for integrating new processes and tools into development workflow
* Operations Engineer: responsible for integrating new processes and tools into deployment workflow

## Epics
* [Automate testing](epics/epic_2.1.md)

## Test Plan

* Test that all necessary tools and technologies are in place for continuous integration and deployment
* Test that code is properly tested and verified before deployment
* Test that automated monitoring and alerting is in place to identify and address issues quickly
* Test that security measures are in place and adhered to throughout the development and deployment process
