Task Title: Define test coverage metrics and track them over time.

User Story: As a developer, I want to have automated tests that run with each build, so that I can catch bugs early and avoid regressions.

Description: The development team will define test coverage metrics (e.g. code coverage, functional coverage) and track them over time to ensure that sufficient testing is performed. The metrics will help the team identify areas where testing needs improvement and ensure that the tests are providing adequate coverage.
